# Palindrome Checker
Here we reverse a string and test it as a palindrome using C# and the MVC pattern. Write a program that displays the reverse of an input string of characters. Display the reversal in GREEN and state whether it is a Palindrome or not.

## Palindrome
A word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., madam or nurses run.

## Instructions
Enter a word or sentence. Press the button and the input will be evaluated on whether it is a palindrome or not. The resulting reversal of the string will also appear.
